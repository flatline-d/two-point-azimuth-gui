Lutz_JGR_1986_fig13_data_readme.txt

This file Lutz_JGR_1986_fig13_data.csv is a two-column point dataset in comma-separate-value (.csv) format. Points represent the centroids of magnetic anomaly contour closures over MD-PD-NJ (Maryland-Pennsylvania-New Jersey) tri-state intersection from Lutz [1986] figure 13.

The original figure in Lutz contains no coordinate markers around the exterior frame, so lat, lon coordinates were arbitrarily assigned a value between 0 to 1Â° to preserve the original figures aspect ratio of 1.18.
